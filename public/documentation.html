                                "Bio": "Darren Aronofsky was born February 12, 1969, in Brooklyn, New York. Growing up, Darren was always artistic: he
                                loved classic movies and, as a teenager, he even spent time doing graffiti art. After high school, Darren went to
                                Harvard University to study film (both live-action and animation). He won several film awards after completing his
                                senior thesis film, Supermarket Sweep, starring Sean Gillette, which went on to becoming a National Student Academy
                                Award finalist. Aronofsky didn't make a feature film until five years later, in February 1996, where he began creating
                                the concept for Pi (1998). After Darren's script for Pi (1998) received great reactions from friends, he began
                                production. The film re-teamed Aronofsky with Gillette, who played the lead. This went on to further successes, such as
                                Requiem for a Dream (2000), The Wrestler (2008) and Black Swan (2010). Most recently, he completed the films Noah (2014)
                                and Mother! (2017).",<br>
